## Water Quality Improvement Goals, Schedules, and Strategies

This section summarizes the progress toward achieving the interim and final numeric goals and strategy implementation for the Highest Priority Water Quality Conditions (HPWQCs) within the applicable Hydrologic Areas (HAs) of the Carlsbad WMA during the reporting period. Identifying goals and the means to achieve them is a fundamental component of the WQIP. The goals, strategies, and schedules were established through the WQIP development process, and details are included in the current WQIP (September 2021).

The Responsible Agencies (RAs) implement strategies as part of their Jurisdictional Runoff Management Programs (JRMPs) and WQIP(s). A compilation of JRMP Annual Report data for FY23 is provided in **Appendix C**, demonstrating the collective efforts for jurisdictional implementation throughout the WMA. Thirteen strategies (i.e., core strategies) represent JRMP activities required by the MS4 permit, while other strategies have been identified to support progress toward WQIP goals. All strategies aim to protect, preserve, enhance, or restore water quality and designated beneficial uses of waterways within each HA. While some strategies focus on specific sources and stressors that potentially contribute to the HPWQC and PWQCs, others are more general and provide multiple water quality benefits. This multi-benefit approach is essential to maintaining and improving overall WMA health. These strategies and efforts are implemented on a regional, watershed, or jurisdictional scale, and implementation of these strategies during the reporting period is presented in **Appendix D**.

Over $19.8 million in RA program implementation expenditures were reported in FY23 by agencies in the Carlsbad WMA to improve water quality. This total expenditure includes funding for implementing over 70 strategies throughout the WMA, which contribute to improving or protecting water quality. The expenditures include jurisdictional program implementation, which, when combined as a watershed, resulted in the following outcomes:

- 1,952 investigations of non-storm water discharges conducted
- 1,459 non-storm water discharges eliminated
- 1,299 illicit discharges/connections eliminated
- 7,615 construction site inspections
- 4,932 existing development inspections
- 3,017 tons of debris removed from MS4 structures and facilities
- 5,494 tons of debris removed through street sweeping efforts
- 1,617 high priority development structural BMP inspections
- 104 public outreach events conducted

The RAs also participated in several regional efforts to improve water quality in the Carlsbad WMA (**Appendix D**). For example, RAs improved the Project Clean Water website to increase educational resources, promoted the “52 Ways to Love Your Water” pledge to spread storm water awareness, and sponsored several I Love a Clean San Diego clean-up events. Clean-up events resulted in the removal of over 21,043 pounds of trash and recyclables in the Carlsbad WMA and approximately 76,980 pounds region-wide.

## Upcoming Goals and Progress

The following sub-sections present the upcoming interim and final goals and progress toward goals for each HA. Monitoring performed as part of the goal progress assessment is presented, and each sub-section concludes with strategy implementation highlights to address the respective HPWQC.

> Note: Key highlights of jurisdictional implementation activities presented is not a comprehensive list of implementation outcomes.

## 3.1 Loma Alta Hydrologic Area

The Highest Priority Water Quality Condition (HPWQC) for the Loma Alta HA (Figure 4) is eutrophic conditions in the Loma Alta Slough between May and October. The interim and final goals, progress toward those goals, and strategy highlights are presented in the following sub-sections.

#### Figure of Loma Alta Hydrologic Area (Figure 4)

### 3.1.1 Goal Progress

The numeric goals for Loma Alta HA are based on macroalgal biomass (grams dry weight per cubic meter – g dw/m³) and macroalgal cover (percent cover) conditions in Loma Alta Slough from May through October. The interim and final goals to address HPWQCs in the Loma Alta HA and the progress toward goals are presented in Table 4.

Results from the Long-Term Water Quality Monitoring at Loma Alta Slough Monitoring Program (Weston Solutions, 2022) confirm the successful attainment of both interim and final numeric goals, see Attachment 1 of the FY22 Carlsbad WQIP Annual Report. Furthermore, the results for 2022 show the lowest macroalgal biomass and percent cover measured in the entire history of the monitoring program. This reduction in biomass has been a consistent trend since 2017, demonstrating statistically-significant decrease.

**Figure 5** and **Figure 6** below compare results from the monitoring years 2016 through 2022 to interim and final goals. These figures illustrate that both macroalgal cover and macroalgal biomass goals have been consistently met since 2016 and 2019, respectively. The 2022 summer monitoring period was the final year of monitoring required under Resolution No. R9-2014-0020. This resolution required the incorporation of Loma Alta Slough’s final numeric targets into the Carlsbad WQIP and for monitoring to be conducted from 2016-2022.

During the FY23 reporting period, the City of Oceanside confirmed with the RWQCB that the monitoring program was completed after the 2022 sampling period, as both final numeric goals were met and the monitoring period specified in the Resolution has ended.

_Note: The County of San Diego is no longer a Responsible Agency (RA) in the Loma Alta HA. The two parcels within the unincorporated area were annexed to the City of Vista during the reporting period._

### 3.1.2 Hydrologic Area Strategy Highlights

Strategies to highlight in the Loma Alta HA include the Loma Alta Slough Wetlands Enhancement Project and Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project strategies. As discussed below, both strategies are restoration efforts aimed to achieve multiple benefits including habitat enhancement, flood protection, water quality improvements, preservation of open space, and enhancing recreational opportunities. For additional strategies implemented in the HA during the reporting period, refer to **Appendix D**.

#### Loma Alta Slough Wetland Enhancement Project

The Loma Alta Slough Wetlands Enhancement Project addresses the priority eutrophic water quality condition at Loma Alta Slough and aims to achieve multiple benefits through the restoration of ecological functions and protection of infrastructure from future climate-driven impacts. The project has existed in a conceptual phase for years as the City of Oceanside worked to acquire private properties surrounding the Slough beginning in the 1990s. In 2018, the city was awarded a Proposition 1 planning grant from the ...

#### Figure 7: Loma Alta Slough

State Coastal Conservancy to complete the
required studies, preliminary design, and
environmental documentation for a
comprehensive restoration project. The
project enhances the hydrologic function
and habitat quality of existing coastal salt
marsh and brackish freshwater wetlands by
removing invasive species, dredging new
wetland areas, and removing non-native
infill to widen the extent of Loma Alta
Slough. The restoration improves the
existing habitat by enhancing water circulation and establishing new habitat ecotones to provide refuge
for sensitive coastal species. Of the total six-acre project footprint, the restoration creates an additional
three acres of new wetlands at the Slough, which will play an important role in nutrient reduction by
removing nitrogen and phosphorus while providing infrastructure protection from increased storm
intensity and sea-level rise from expected climate change. The project design is taking a multi-benefit
approach, balancing the need for water quality improvements with flood risk reduction, coastal
infrastructure protection, and recreational opportunities through the inclusion of a trail system

#### Figure 8: Loma Alta Slough

During the FY23 reporting period, substantial progress was made in readying the project for construction.
In addition to prior committed construction funding of $1M from the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the Ocean
Protection Council awarded an additional over $1M in June 2022. The following was achieved in the FY23
reporting period:

- Acquisition of three major agency permits required for construction, including a CDFW Streambed
  Alteration agreement, RWQCB 401 water quality certification, and Coastal Commission
  Development Permit;

- Finalized the project’s 90% engineering plan set and began the City’s internal entitlement process
  to approve a Discretionary Development Plan for the area;

- Coordinated project construction with three other major CIP projects surrounding the restoration
  footprint, which includes trail connections to a future extension of the Coastal Rail Trail through
  south Oceanside; and
- City Council certification of the project’s Final CEQA Documentation, including adoption of the
  Mitigated Negative Declaration, Mitigation Plan and Notice of Determination

The city expects the final Construction Documents to be completed in late 2023. Pending final regulatory
approvals and sufficient construction funding, the City expects to put the project out to bid in early 2024,
with Phase 1 construction planned for late 2024. Implementation depends entirely on available grant
funding, as concerns persist that inflationary and economic pressures have increased the estimated costs
for Phase 1.

#### Figure 10: Loma Alta Slough Wetlands

The city is coordinating the Enhancement Project construction with three important infrastructure
projects in the vicinity of Loma Alta Slough, including the future decommissioning of the La Salina
wastewater treatment plant, the Coastal Rail Trail extension southward over Loma Alta Creek, and future upgrades to Buccaneer Park. Completing these projects is synergistic as they will benefit one another by
encouraging climate-friendly transit, restoring historical wetland habitats, and fostering public awareness
of the value of open space creation and conservation.

#### Figure 11: Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project

Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project
In the FY23 reporting period, the City of Oceanside
completed substantial work on the Garrison Creek
Native Habitat Restoration Project. This project is a
Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP),
designed in cooperation with the RWQCB, to
mitigate previous environmental impacts to the
Loma Alta HA from a domestic sewage spill in 2015.
The restoration work is intended to mitigate prior
impacts to the Loma Alta tributary and enhance its
biological and community value above its original
condition. The project involves removing and
controlling invasive vegetation within a 20-acre
open space area of the Garrison Creek drainage and
restoring over three acres of riparian forest and
Diegan Coastal Sage Scrub habitat to benefit sensitive and threatened avian species. The project includes
improvements to an existing public trail system with new interpretive signage to educate the community
about the value of riparian habitat, restoration, and connectivity of watersheds and water quality in the
Loma Alta HA.
During FY23, the city worked with its restoration partners, the Nature Collective and Friends of El Corazon,
to conduct multiple invasive species treatments, installation of restoration irrigation, native plants, and
broadcast seeding. The project is currently in Year 5 of the monitoring period and near achieving the
success criteria for native habitat establishment and invasives control. As of the last vegetation monitoring
event in July/August 2023, the restoration areas have increased to over 80% native species cover, well
above the SEP restoration success criteria target of 65% native cover.

## 3.2 Agua Hedionda Hydrologic Area

The HPWQCs for the Agua Hedionda HA (Figure 13) are riparian habitat degradation and
hydromodification impacts. The interim and final goals, progress toward those goals, and strategy
highlights are presented in the following sub-sections.

#### Figure 13: Agua Hedionda Hydrologic Area

### 3.2.1 Goal Progress

In the Agua Hedionda HA, restoration projects have been identified as goals to address riparian habitat
degradation and hydromodification impact HPWQCs. Restoration of riparian habitats and other natural
features supports healthy watersheds by providing critical habitat for wildlife, reducing creek bank
erosion, maintaining stable creek channel geomorphology, and enhancing natural processes to filter
pollutants such as nutrients and sediment. In the Agua Hedionda HA, goal progress is based on advancing
specific project implementation, as presented in [Table 5](Table5).
